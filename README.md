# rock-paper-scissors
This is a 5 round game of Rock, Paper, Scissors played between a player and the computer. The purpose of this project was to put into practice the use of loops and creating functions. In order to get the game to work properly, I also had to put to use nesting, the rules of global scope vs function scope, and the Math.random() function for the computer selection.
